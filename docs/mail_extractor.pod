=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

=head2 Format

The configuration file format allows for either a single-, multi-, comment- or blank-line entry.

Each single-line entry must adhere to following format:

    key = 'value'
    # or
    key = "value"

Each multi-line entry must adhere to following format:

    key = (
        'value1'
        "value2"
        ..
    )

Each comment-line entry may begin with whitespace and must be followed by #.

Each blank-line entry is either a whitespace-only or an entirely empty line.

A valid configuration file with sample values looks as follows:

    source_path = '/path/to/directory'
    output_path = '/path/to/directory'
    log_file    = '/path/to/file'
    excludes    = (
    )
